List of Observations && To-Do

1 ) Make main call async of both threads binance && bitstamp streams,
For now its just to have an idea of a desirable result.

2 ) For the loop iterate the values of the variables to vector of each
crypto & make it mutable(push oldest insert newest), print out the latest value
and refresh screen without crashing the order.


config.json : make a struct iterable to {key:val} without taking care of it size
so it can map whole values and the rest of the calls adapt to it.
